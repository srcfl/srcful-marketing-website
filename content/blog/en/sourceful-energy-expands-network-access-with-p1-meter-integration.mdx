Sourceful Energy is expanding access to its energy optimization and rewards network through **new P1 Meter support in our Energy Gateway firmware. **This integration opens up participation to homes and businesses regardless of whether they have solar panels or battery storage systems installed.

A P1 Meter, or "P1 Port," is a standardized digital interface found in modern smart electricity meters, particularly common in European countries like the Netherlands, Belgium and the Nordics. This interface provides **real-time access to your electricity consumption **and, when applicable, production data. Every 10 seconds, the P1 port broadcasts detailed information about your energy usage, making it a valuable tool for monitoring and optimizing your energy consumption. Unlike other meter reading solutions, P1 meters provide this data through a standardized protocol, ensuring reliable and consistent measurements.

A common use case for the P1 meter is **managing home load balancing across different phases. **This means that, for example, you can charge your electric car, run the dishwasher, and have the washing machine going at the same time, all while being confident that no circuit breakers will trip. The smart EV charger can adjust its energy consumption based on the real-time data provided by the P1 meter, ensuring everything runs smoothly without overloading the system.

The P1 Meter integration represents an important step in our mission to **create a more responsive energy network.** By connecting your P1 Meter through our Energy Gateway, you can participate in energy optimization programs that benefit both you and the grid. The Gateway collects data about your energy consumption patterns, enabling participation in grid balancing initiatives while providing you with detailed insights into your usage.

For homeowners, this means you can soon **start participating in our network with just a P1 Meter and Energy Gateway **- no additional equipment required. If you do have solar panels or battery storage, these can be integrated as well, but they're not necessary to get started.

We're currently in the early stages of rolling out this functionality. Our team is **actively testing different P1 Meter models** to ensure compatibility, and we'll be updating our technical documentation with a list of validated devices. While this initial release focuses on the Gateway firmware update, we're committed to expanding compatibility and features based on user feedback and testing results.

**The idea is straightforward: **once your P1 Meter is connected to a Sourceful Energy Gateway running the latest firmware, you'll be able to monitor your energy usage through our platform and participate in our optimization programs. This creates opportunities to earn rewards while contributing to grid stability, all without requiring significant changes to your existing setup.

**To learn more about P1 Meter compatibility and Gateway availability in your area, head to our **[**Discord Server.**](https://discord.com/invite/srcful)** As we validate more devices and expand our support, we'll keep our documentation updated with the latest technical specifications and compatible meter models.
