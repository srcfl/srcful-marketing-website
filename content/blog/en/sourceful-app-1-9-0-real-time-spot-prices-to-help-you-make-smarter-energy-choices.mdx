# Sourceful App 1.9.0: Real-Time Spot Prices to Help You Make Smarter Energy Choices

*
We're thrilled to announce the release of Sourceful App version 1.9.0, bringing you powerful new features designed to make your energy management experience more seamless, accessible, and insightful than ever before.

#### Swedish Language Support - Energy Management in Your Language

The Sourceful App now supports Swedish, making it easier for our Swedish users to navigate their energy journey in their preferred language. This is just the beginning - more languages are on the way as we continue to make sustainable energy accessible to everyone.

Whether you prefer Svenska, English, or want the app to match your system settings, you're now in complete control of your language experience.

#### Unified Login System - Simpler, Smoother, Secure

Say goodbye to login hassles! We've completely reimagined our authentication system with a unified email-based login that works seamlessly across all platforms. Whether you're using the Phantom login or need to migrate your existing account, the process is now more straightforward and secure than ever.

Your account, your energy data, your way - all protected by Privy's robust authentication infrastructure.

#### Introducing Sourceful Lifetime - For Our Early Believers

A special thank you to our early adopters! We're introducing the Sourceful Lifetime subscription model, designed to reward those who believed in our vision from the start. With infinite active status, eternal payment plans, and zero future payments, this is our way of saying "tack" to the community that's been with us on this journey.

Your trust in us as we build the future of distributed energy deserves recognition, and Sourceful Lifetime is just the beginning.

#### Real-Time Spot Prices - Make Smarter Energy Choices

Knowledge is power, and power should be affordable. Our new spot price feature gives you real-time visibility into electricity prices, helping you make intelligent decisions about when to charge your EV, run your appliances, or feed energy back to the grid.

With clear visualizations showing current prices (like today's 0.62 kr/kWh) and historical trends, you can now optimize your energy consumption and maximize your savings. Track peaks and valleys, understand pricing patterns, and take control of your energy costs like never before.

#### What's Next?

This release is a significant step forward in our mission to make distributed energy coordination accessible to everyone. As we continue to develop our EV Pro bidirectional charger and expand our Home Pro capabilities, the Sourceful App will be your command center for the energy transition.

We're already working on the next set of features based on your feedback, including enhanced V2G scheduling, deeper integration with Swedish electricity areas and more sophisticated peak shaving algorithms.

#### Download Version 1.9.0 Today

Update your Sourceful App now to experience these new features. Whether you're managing your home's energy, optimizing your EV charging, or simply staying informed about energy prices, version 1.9.0 puts you in control.

Join us in building a more sustainable, distributed energy future - one update at a time.
