Sourceful Energy is entering into a partnership with Kalmar Energi to give household customers access to real-time data about their electricity consumption. With the help of the proprietary meter reader Zap, customers can see their electricity and power usage directly in Kalmar Energi's app and thereby gain concrete tools to influence their electricity costs and contribute to a more stable electricity system.

The collaboration is being launched ahead of the new pricing model being introduced in 2026, where the fee will be partially based on how much power is used simultaneously during the most loaded hours. Zap makes it easy to identify these peaks and even out consumption throughout the day.

"We develop technology that makes energy management understandable and accessible to everyone. Together with Kalmar Energi, we're showing how digital tools can create direct customer value while simultaneously strengthening the energy system as a whole," says Fredrik Ahlgren, CEO of Sourceful Energy.

#### How Sourceful Zap Works

Zap connects directly to the home's electricity meter and connects to WiFi in just a few minutes. Data is sent in real-time to Kalmar Energi's app, where the user gets a clear overview of their electricity consumption and power peaks. By spreading out the use of, for example, washing machines, ovens, and EV charging, households can both reduce their costs and contribute to a more balanced electricity grid.

Kalmar Energi will offer Zap to its electricity network and electricity trading customers during winter 2025/26. Pricing and ordering information will be published in Kalmar Energi's app and on their website in connection with the launch.
