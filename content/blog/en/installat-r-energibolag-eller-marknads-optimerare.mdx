#### Learn more about our new open EMS system and coordinate your energy resources smarter.

As the energy industry shakes under pressure from a rapidly changing landscape - where several companies have unfortunately gone bankrupt in a short time, both on the installer side and among technical product companies - [**Sourceful Energy**](https://sourceful.energy) wants to take a clear step in the opposite direction: **we choose to open up**.

We believe that the **future energy system** must be built on **transparency** and **interoperability**. That's why we're now launching our open [EMS platform](https://docs.sourceful.energy/developer/ems) - **a technical foundation that others can build upon**, instead of every player having to develop their own solution to connect and enable control of **solar panels, batteries, and other distributed energy resources**.

#### A Platform for Control and Collaboration

Our platform is a hub for **control**, **optimization**, and **automation** of distributed energy resources (DERs) - such as **solar panels**, **batteries**, and **EVs**. Through the platform, **property owners**, **energy companies**, and **other third-party actors** can integrate their resources and thereby contribute to **lower costs for their customers, improved operations, and more efficient use of our grid**.

A central component is the Sourceful Energy Gateway, which enables anyone to connect local resources to the platform at **low cost**, enabling real-time data and smart control in real-time or according to scheduled operations.

#### An Open Model with Room for Innovation

Our EMS is not a closed control system - quite the opposite. The platform is designed so that intelligence comes from external actors, so-called *Providers*. These can be **third-party companies**, **energy service providers**, or others building their own **optimization logic** on top of our open infrastructure.

Through our API, these actors get access to all relevant data to make informed decisions and the ability to control a battery according to their own optimization schedules. Everything is built with secure authentication and high scalability in focus.

#### We Share to Drive the Industry Forward

Why do we do this? Because we want to **lower the barriers for innovation** in the energy industry. Because we know that **no one wins** when every player builds and maintains their own technical infrastructure. And because we believe in a **smarter grid** - where **flexibility**, **collaboration**, and **open standards** are the way forward.

The technical integration and aggregation looks fundamentally the same regardless of where in Europe you are. What differs, however, are regulations, incentives, and market practices. *That's why we want to collaborate with partners who know their local markets better than we do.*

We are currently in a controlled beta phase, connecting selected systems and fine-tuning the features. But our ambition is clear: *we're building something that more people can use, improve, and grow with.*

Are you an **installer**, **energy company**, **market optimizer**, or another actor looking for an easy way to connect and smarter coordinate smaller energy resources?

**Get in touch!**
