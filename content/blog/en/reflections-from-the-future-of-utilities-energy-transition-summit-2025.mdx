# Reflections from the Future of Utilities Energy Transition Summit 2025

Last week, I had the opportunity to attend the **Future of Utilities Energy Transition Summit** in Amsterdam - my first time at the event, and certainly not the last. Over two dynamic days filled with **insights**, **inspiration**, and** impactful networking**, the conference brought together **key players from across the energy ecosystem**, all focused on one shared goal: **accelerating the transition to a smarter, greener energy future**.

#### Insightful Talks from Industry Leaders

The event delivered a strong lineup of presentations and panel discussions. One standout was Cindy Kroon**, CCO at Vattenfall, who spoke about the challenge of striking the right balance in the energy mix under the theme “Affordable, green, secure: striking the balance across the energy mix.”* Her perspective highlighted the ongoing tension between sustainability, affordability, and reliability — a topic that resonated deeply across the audience.**Another highlight was Philip Steele**, Future Technologies Evangelist at Octopus Energy, who explored *“Unlocking the digital frontier: Transforming energy systems for a sustainable future.”* His talk provided a compelling vision for how digital innovation — from AI to smart grids — is reshaping the way we produce, manage, and consume energy.

#### Conversations That Matter

One of the most valuable aspects of the summit was the space it created for meaningful, personal conversations**. I had great discussions with **Kristoffer Fröjd** and **Magnus Westman Larsson** from Ellevio, and **Niklas Johansson** from E.ON, where we dived into the growing need for flexibility in the grid - especially as decentralized energy resources continue to scale.**These exchanges reminded me just how essential collaboration is if we’re to succeed in building the energy system of tomorrow.

#### Startups, Innovation & New Partnerships

It was also exciting to meet fellow founders and innovators driving tech solutions in the energy space. One particularly inspiring encounter was with Ioannis Kasinopoulos**, Co-founder of **Electryone AI**, a company offering cutting-edge solutions in energy asset management using AI. We had a great conversation about potential partnership opportunities - and it was clear that **flexibility in the energy system is top of mind** for many across the industry.
