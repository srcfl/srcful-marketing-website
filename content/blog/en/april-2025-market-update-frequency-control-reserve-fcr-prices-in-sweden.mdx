# April 2025 Market Update: Frequency Control Reserve (FCR) Prices in Sweden

Every month, Svenska kraftnät - the Swedish national grid operator - publishes updates on balancing services like FCR. These services help keep the electricity grid stable, especially when supply and demand don’t match. Here's a quick overview of what happened in April 2025 on the FCR markets.

#### What is FCR?

FCR stands for Frequency Containment Reserve*. It's used to quickly correct any imbalances in the power system. There are three types:

- FCR-N (Normal)**: Keeps the frequency stable during normal operations.

- **FCR-D up**: Adds electricity to the grid when frequency drops.

- **FCR-D down**: Removes electricity when frequency is too high.

#### **Key Highlights for April

- Prices increased** for all three FCR services compared to earlier this year.

- However, **prices are still lower than April 2024**, especially for FCR-D products.

- **FCR-N averaged 37.4 EUR/MW** — the highest monthly average in 2025 so far.

- **FCR-D up averaged 8.91 EUR/MW**, and **FCR-D down averaged 11.38 EUR/MW**.

- FCR-D down had **very large price swings**, from as low as **1.38 EUR/MW** up to **773.71 EUR/MW** during one peak on April 27.

#### **Why are prices changing?

- A higher demand** for reserve power was introduced starting January 2025 — especially for FCR-D down. This added more volume to the market.

- More **battery storage systems** have joined the market, increasing competition.

- Water flow from melting snow (spring flood) affects **hydropower**, which also impacts FCR prices.

- The new **pay-as-cleared** pricing model (used since February 2024) may lead to higher or more volatile prices compared to the older pay-as-bid system.

#### **Regional Trends

- Southern Sweden (SE3 and SE4) is now more active** in the FCR markets, compared to the north (SE1 and SE2), which used to dominate.

- The shift is driven by **new participants** — particularly battery systems — entering the market in the south.

#### **Supply Update

As of April 1, 2025:

- Battery capacity qualified for FCR-N** increased by **30%** since January.

- Battery capacity for **FCR-D up** rose from **610 MW to 670 MW**.

- **Flexible consumption** is growing slowly, but still plays a small role in the market.
