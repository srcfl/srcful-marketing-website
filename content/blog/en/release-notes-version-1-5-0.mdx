# App Version 1.5.0 Release Notes

We’ve just launched **version 1.5.0** of the Sourceful Energy app - and while many of the biggest changes are under the hood, this release sets the stage for some exciting features on the horizon.

#### What’s New

##### Redesigned Navigation

We’ve completely rebuilt the app’s navigation system to make it faster, cleaner, and more future-proof. You’ll notice the difference right away with the new, snappier menu - and it’s just the beginning of **what’s possible with this foundation**.

##### Improved Data Views

We’re putting your energy data front and center. This update introduces **dedicated screens** for your **Solar PVs, Batteries**, and **Energy Meters** — each now with early graphing capabilities to help you start exploring your data more visually.

##### Delegated Wallet Login

Accessing your **advanced Dashboard** is now as simple as scanning a QR code from within the app. No more switching tabs or copy-pasting keys. Just tap, scan, and you’re in.

##### Tweaks & Fixes

- **Reward data** now shows yesterday’s totals (the latest available), instead of today’s incomplete count.

- The **Gateway Settings page** has been refreshed in preparation for upcoming features.

- Plus, general bug fixes and performance improvements across the board.

#### Coming Soon: Sites

As we've been building 1.5.0, one thing became clear: to unlock more powerful insights, we need to better organize energy resources. That's why our next big focus is on introducing "Sites".**

##### What are Sites?

Sites will be a way for account holders to group Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) - like PVs, batteries, and meters - by location. You’ll be able to add helpful info like plant ID numbers, fuse sizes, and more. Once set up, your site’s data will be displayed as a **combined graph**, giving you a fuller picture of your energy setup.

Sites are designed to give you **smarter, more actionable views** - and they’ll be a major part of our **May release**.
