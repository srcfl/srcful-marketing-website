# The Day Everything Changes

I'm sitting here writing this with my second cup of coffee at 6:47 in the morning, as the sun rises over our office in Kalmar, and I can barely contain myself. After months of sleepless nights, countless iterations, and more technical challenges than I can count, we're finally here.

Today we're not just presenting products. We're launching the future of how every home will manage energy.

#### Let me tell you what we've built

I've been deeply involved in the energy world for over a decade - first optimizing fuel consumption for ships through machine learning, then building IoT networks. But here's what I've realized: We're not building yet another energy dashboard or a smarter thermostat. We're building the coordination layer that makes distributed energy actually work.

The energy transition won't be solved from the top down. It's being built from the edges. And the missing piece - the one we're solving at Sourceful - is coordination.

#### Sourceful EV Pro: The missing link between your car and the grid

For those with a V2G-capable EV, we have something special.

**V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid)** and **V2H (Vehicle-to-Home)** mean your EV can send electricity back - either to the grid or to your home. Your car becomes a rolling battery that can both charge and discharge. The technology already exists in many new EVs, but has been locked away or required expensive installations.

Right now your car is an isolated asset. It charges, it drives, it sits idle. But what if it could actually interact with the energy system around it?

Your car has a 75 kWh battery. Your home uses maybe 30 kWh per day. The electrical system desperately needs flexible resources. The economics are already there - but the coordination layer has been missing.

When electricity prices spike, your EV becomes your home's own power reserve. When the grid needs balancing, your car can participate and get compensated. When your solar panels produce excess, the car stores it for the evening.

Early users are already seeing 40-60% lower electricity costs. The system ensures your car is always ready when you need it.

**Launching first in Scandinavia** - because this is where the regulations actually work.

#### Sourceful Home Pro: Power management that actually works

You know what frustrates me? Everyone has smart meters now, but they're only smart for the utility company. At the end of the month comes the cold shower: "Your peak power was 11 kW for one hour - here's a capacity charge of €150."

You didn't even know about it.

**For those with solar panels it's even worse:** When electricity prices go negative, you literally pay the grid to take your energy. It's completely insane.

Sourceful Home Pro changes that:

- **Real-time monitoring** so you see exactly what's happening

- **Warnings** before you hit expensive power peaks

- **Automatic export control** - stops export when prices are negative

- **Smart coordination** with your EV and solar panels

We're talking about savings of thousands per year just by knowing when to wait with the dishwasher. Plus you stop paying to give away your solar electricity.

**Price:** ~€3/month - hardware included**Availability:** Now in Scandinavia

#### The coordination layer for energy

Sourceful bridges the gap between your home resources (solar panels, battery, EV) and a smarter grid. We're becoming energy's coordination layer - we give utilities cost-effective access to flexibility while making homeowners into autonomous energy nodes.

The system is growing. The network is becoming more stable. Partners are seeking us out, not the other way around.

#### To our community

**To our early adopters:** Those who bought a Blixt or Zap get lifetime Sourceful subscription at no cost. You believed in us first, and we never forget that.

**Regarding tokens:** We're sticking to the vision, but prioritizing building a solid product first. A real coordination layer with actual utility. Then comes the token.

#### What happens now

In the coming months we'll:

- Roll out Home Pro to more markets

- Begin beta testing EV Pro with selected partners

- Launch more integrations

- Build out the team

#### Ready to coordinate?

The energy transition is in full swing - but until now, coordination has been missing. That changes now.

To all of you who've followed us from the Helium network days, through the journey from Srcful to Sourceful - thank you. This is the result of months of work creating the coordination infrastructure the energy world needs.

The future of energy isn't just distributed. It's coordinated. And that coordination layer? We're building it right now.
