# Seamless Authentication: Log into Your Energy Dashboard Without the Hassle

Tobias Olsson
*
Simplifying access to your energy resources with just a smartphone scan*

#### Say Goodbye to Browser Extensions and Wallet Installations

We're excited to announce a major upgrade to the Sourceful Energy Dashboard that makes managing your energy resources simpler and more secure than ever before. With our new Bifrost authentication system, you can now log into [app.srcful.io](https://app.srcful.io/) directly from your smartphone – no browser extensions or external wallet installations required!

**

#### How It Works: Just Scan and Go

Logging into your Dashboard is now as simple** as scanning a QR code:

- Visit [app.srcful.io](https://app.srcful.io/) on your computer

- Use your smartphone to scan the QR code displayed on your screen

- Approve the login request on your phone when prompted

- You're in! Your Dashboard automatically logs you in

The entire process **takes seconds**, and you never have to **worry about installing additional software on your computer** or **managing wallet extensions across multiple browsers**.

**

#### Security You Can Trust

*While we've made the login process simpler, we haven't compromised on security**. In fact, Bifrost enhances your security in several ways:*

- **Your private keys never leave your phone** - all sensitive cryptographic information stays securely within the Sourceful Energy App or in your external wallet like Phantom

- **Time-limited sessions** - the QR code automatically refreshes every few minutes for added security

- **Explicit approval required** - you must actively approve each login attempt on your phone

- **No gateway transfers** - you can do almost everything using this form of authentication but you cannot transfer gateways to another wallet.

**
⚠️ Important Security Warning****Be aware of potential phishing attempts. No one from Sourceful Energy will ever send you a QR code or link and ask you to scan it to "validate" your login. Only scan QR codes that you generate yourself by visiting [app.srcful.io](http://app.srcful.io/) directly in your browser. If you receive any suspicious authentication requests that you didn't initiate, please report them to [support@srcful.io](mailto:security@srcful.io) immediately.

#### Benefits for All Users

*This new authentication method is particularly valuable for:*

- New users** who want to get started without technical hurdles

- **Users who work across multiple computers** and don't want to install extensions everywhere

- **Security-conscious users** who prefer keeping their keys isolated on their smartphone

- **Corporate environments** where installing browser extensions may be restricted

**

#### Try It Today

Already have the Sourceful Energy App? Simply visit [app.srcful.io](https://app.srcful.io/) and look for the QR code** on the **right side of the login screen**. Within seconds, you'll be managing **all your energy resources** from one convenient dashboard.**Don't have the app yet?
