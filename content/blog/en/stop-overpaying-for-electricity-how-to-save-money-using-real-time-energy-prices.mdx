# Electricity prices change all the time. But your life doesn’t have to.

Let’s be honest: the world probably doesn’t need another app that simply shows what electricity costs right now.

Most energy providers already offer that. Seeing the spot price has become a baseline functionality at this point. And honestly, nobody wants to plan their daily life around whether electricity costs 4 cents or 8 cents at this very moment. Life is too short to obsess over a graph on your phone.

Still, in the Sourceful Energy app, we chose to show the prices anyway. And we do it exceptionally well. Not because we think you want to chase pennies 24/7, but because price is the single most important signal the energy system gives us.

### What Are Spot Prices (and Why Should You Care)?

Across most of Europe, electricity is bought and sold on wholesale markets where prices shift from hour to hour based on supply and demand. This is called the "spot price" or "day-ahead price".

You’ve probably noticed how dramatically these prices can swing. One hour the price is negative, the next it’s spiking. This is what we call The Abundance Paradox.

We’ve built an incredible amount of renewable energy.  So when the sun shines or the wind picks up, we sometimes produce more electricity than we can use, and prices drop fast.

**Cheap:** late at night (low demand), weekends and holidays (less industrial usage), or on windy, sunny days (high renewable production).When electricity is expensive:

**Expensive:** in the early evenings when everyone comes home, cooks dinner, and industry is still running at full capacity (high demand).

These extreme swings are not chaos. They’re a message. They’re the heartbeat of the grid. And if you want to understand what’s happening in your home, you need to see that pulse.

### Knowledge beats guesswork.

This is where Sourceful Energy comes in. We built Sourceful Zap to give you the clearest, fastest, and most accurate picture of your energy usage.

We don’t believe you should micromanage your entire life around electricity prices. But information is power. And for anyone who wants to take a hands-on approach to saving, real-time data is an unbeatable tool.

#### Real-World Example:

Let’s say you need to charge your EV with 36 kWh (to drive about 200 km).

On December 4, 2025, prices for Elevio customers in Sweden's SE3 region looked like this in the Sourceful Energy app:

Time PeriodPrice (EUR/kWh) Elevio SE3
00:00 - 04:00

0.054 - 0.060

04:00 - 08:00

0.058 - 0.129

08:00 - 12:00

0.095 - 0.143

12:00 - 16:00

0.131 - 0.153

16:00 - 20:00

0.116 - 0.146

20:00 - 00:00

0.076 - 0.129

Daily average: ~ 0.106 EUR/kWh (daily low 0.054 EUR/kWh) (daily high 0.153 EUR/kWh)

**Option A (you guess):** You plug in when you get home at 18:00. The price is high, around 0.116 - 0.146 EUR/kWh **Cost: *~ *4.20 - 5.29 EUR*

Option B (you know):** You see in the Sourceful app that the price drops to 0.054 - 0.060 EUR/kWh after midnight. You wait or schedule the charging.***Cost: *~ *1.92 - 2.19 EUR*

You save 2.28 - 3.11 EUR on a single charge by simply doing nothing except waiting. Do that twice a week and you're saving hundreds per year.

Sourceful Energy makes acting on this information effortless.

### What you get with our app

- Spot prices at a glance**We remove the noise. If the indicator is green, run the dishwasher or washing machine. If it’s red, maybe wait with the dryer. One glance tells you whether it’s a good time to use energy.

- Planning and recommendations**The app shows exactly when the next low or high price period starts and how long it lasts.**For example:**“Low price in 7 hours 36 minutes: 0.59 SEK/kWh (13 percent below today’s average)”**“Reduce usage in 5 hours 51 minutes: 0.91 SEK/kWh (34 percent above today’s average)”

- Real real-time data**With Sourceful Zap connected to your smart meter (P1 port), you can see what your home is consuming right now and understand your usage patterns.

### But this is only the beginning

Here’s where we truly differ. Our goal is not to make you plan your entire day around electricity prices or constantly check an app.

In the future, you shouldn’t have to do anything at all. Your home should optimise itself.

That’s the vision behind Sourceful Zap. Zap isn’t just a real-time meter, it’s the brain that coordinates your home’s entire energy system.

If you have an EV, solar, a home battery, or a heat pump, Zap will help you take advantage of dynamic electricity prices automatically.

When electricity is cheap, your battery and EV charge up. When prices rise, your home can run on stored energy or export surplus solar power to the grid.

That means you boost your self consumption and buy electricity when it's cheapest.

This saves money, but it also contributes to something bigger:**an energy system where every home is smarter, more flexible, and better integrated with the grid.

This century is about coordination. Your EV, battery, and heat pump are not just energy devices, they are valuable energy assets. When they work together, they benefit both you and the grid, strengthening the entire energy system.

Zap already provides better insights, smarter charging, and more control over costs. But its true power lies ahead: Zap is the first step toward a home that gradually becomes self-optimising and works *with* the grid instead of against it.
