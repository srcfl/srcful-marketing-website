# AI Energy Price Optimisation

We're excited to share what we're working on **behind the scenes at **[**Sourceful Energy**](https://sourceful.energy)! Our team is currently developing a new feature for battery owners - **our AI Energy Optimisation system**.**

#### Perfect Timing for Sweden's New Grid Tariffs

Our Summer 2025 launch in Sweden is perfectly timed with the introduction of new, more flexible grid tariffs being rolled out across the country. These new tariffs make the new optimisation solution even more valuable for Swedish households**.**

##### What are the new grid tariffs?

Grid companies like Ellevio and E.ON are introducing a new pricing model based on power demand** (effekt). Currently, you pay a fixed fee based on your fuse size (säkringsstorlek) plus a variable fee for the amount of electricity you use. With the new model, you'll also pay based on your peak power usage - in the Ellevios price model, the average of your three highest hourly power peaks during different days each month.

##### This means:

- Your grid costs will be **affected** by how evenly you **spread your electricity usage** throughout the day

- **High power peaks** (running many appliances simultaneously) will result in **higher costs**

- Using electricity during off-peak hours (**22:00-06:00**) will be **cheaper**, as o**nly half the peak is counted**

**

#### What is AI Energy Price Optimization?

Our AI price optimization automatically** **charges your battery when electricity prices are low and discharges it when prices are high**, allowing you to **maximize the financial benefits of your energy storage system**. With the new grid tariffs, this system becomes **even more powerful** as it can also help manage your power peaks.

**

#### Starting in Sweden, Expanding to Europe

We're planning to launch first in Sweden in Summer 2025**, where these new variable grid tariffs make it an ideal starting market. After testing and refining our solution in Sweden, **we aim to gradually expand to other European markets as similar tariff structures are adopted**.

**

#### Our AI Approach

Our team is developing a simple yet powerful feature for Sourceful Energy's users in Sweden who have our Energy Gateway connected and our app installed**.

- Consider your consumption patterns to avoid expensive power peaks

- Factor in both spot prices AND the new grid tariffs specific to your location

- Work toward creating an optimized solution for your entire energy setup

**

#### Addressing the Power Peak Challenge

The new Swedish grid tariffs make power peak management essential for cost control**. We aim to **help prevent the expensive power peaks** that occur when batteries, EV chargers, and heat pumps activate simultaneously **during low-price periods by intelligently scheduling these activities**.

**

#### Simplifying Energy Management

Our goal is to have AI handle the complexity of:**

- Spot price differentials

- Grid tariff optimization

- Consumption and weather predictions

- Battery usage optimization

We want the system to do the heavy lifting so you can **focus on enjoying the benefits without the complicated calculations**.

**

#### Calculating Your Potential Savings

In the coming weeks, our team will be conducting detailed simulations to calculate more precise savings estimates** for Swedish households using our AI Price Optimization system. These simulations will account for various household profiles, **battery capacities, solar installations, and the new grid tariff structures**.**We're excited about the initial results and look forward to sharing specific numbers that demonstrate how this could be beneficial** for your **energy costs**. Keep an eye out for a dedicated blog post later this spring where **we'll dive deep into the potential savings and provide examples based on different household scenarios**.
