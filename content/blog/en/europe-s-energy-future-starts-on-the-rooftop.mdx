# Europe’s Energy Future Starts on the Rooftop

*
Reflections on SolarPower Europe’s “Flexible Buildings, Resilient Grids”***If you’re working in energy, the latest report from SolarPower Europe** is a must-read. *“Flexible Buildings, Resilient Grids”* lays out a clear vision: to build a clean, affordable, and resilient energy system, we need to activate Europe’s buildings.**The numbers speak for themselves. By 2030, smart buildings** - equipped with solar PV, batteries, EV chargers, heat pumps, and energy management systems - could deliver:

- **52% of the EU’s daily flexibility needs**

- **35% weekly**

- **29% annually**

**This isn’t theory** - these technologies exist today. What we’re missing isn’t hardware, but **integration**. Most buildings still operate in isolation, rather than as part of the system.**One of the report’s strongest messages is around interoperability**. Europe needs a plug-and-play approach - where devices, platforms, and market actors can speak the same language. Without open APIs, harmonised data protocols, and access to market signals, much of this potential stays locked in.**Another key takeaway:** flexibility isn’t just good for the grid - it pays. The report shows:

- Up to **€29 billion/year** in avoided grid investments

- Energy bill savings of up to **16 euro cents/kWh** depending on tech

- Strong economics for solar + battery + heat pump bundles — especially with dynamic tariffs

**And beyond economics, flexible buildings also mean greater energy security, lower emissions, and less curtailment of renewables.The energy transition is no longer just about adding more generation. It’s about making demand and supply smarter**, and buildings are the key enabler.**We’re seeing this already: homes start participating in balancing markets, EV fleets shifting load in real time, SMEs optimising energy based on grid congestion signals. For those of us building energy software, platforms or control systems, the message is clear: *there’s enormous value in making it easy for buildings to play an active role.****The grid needs it. The market rewards it. And the technology is ready.*👉 [Full report here](https://api.solarpowereurope.org/uploads/Solar_Power_Europe_Flexible_Buildings_Resilient_Grids_V1_f736ab2252.pdf)
