# Security Concerns Over Foreign Inverters Highlight Need for Local DER Control

Lithuania has announced plans to block certain foreign-made solar inverters through new cybersecurity legislation, [as reported by PV Tech](https://www.pv-tech.org/lithuania-to-block-chinese-inverters-with-cybersecurity-legislation/).

This decision underscores a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of distributed energy resources (DERs): the critical importance of maintaining control and ownership of your solar and battery systems. Solar inverters are far more than simple power conversion devices – they're sophisticated computers with remote access capabilities that control critical energy infrastructure.

When these devices connect directly to manufacturer clouds in foreign jurisdictions, they create potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited for unauthorized data collection or even grid manipulation, as highlighted in the Lithuanian government's concerns.

This is one of many reasons why we've developed the Energy Gateway as a secure, local control solution. By implementing our Gateway as a dedicated control layer between your DERs and the wider internet, you maintain complete sovereignty over your energy assets while still enabling smart grid integration.

The Energy Gateway ensures that you – not foreign governments – maintain control over your data and system operations, all while costing just a fraction of traditional industrial control solutions.

The Lithuanian legislation, which will take effect in 2025 according to the PV Tech report, serves as a wake-up call for the industry. As we transition to a decentralized energy future, the security architecture of DERs becomes increasingly critical. The Energy Gateway represents a forward-thinking approach to this challenge, providing secure, transparent control that will be essential for both individual system owners and grid operators.

The need for secure, local hardware control has never been clearer. As more countries review their grid security policies, solutions like the Energy Gateway that prioritize owner control and cybersecurity will become increasingly vital for the future of distributed energy.
