From January 1, 2027, all grid operators in Sweden will introduce power tariffs – a new pricing model that changes how you pay for the electricity grid. It's no longer just about *how much* electricity you use, but also *when* and *how quickly* you use it.

As society electrifies – with EVs, heat pumps, and solar panels – the load on the grid increases. Power tariffs are designed to smooth out these peaks, create incentives for smarter electricity use, and ultimately enable the climate transition.

#### From Energy to Power – What Does It Mean?

Traditional grid fees are primarily based on:

- A fixed fee (kr/year)
- A variable fee (öre/kWh)
- A fuse-based subscription fee

With power tariffs, a new component is added: a fee based on your **highest power usage** during a certain period, such as the highest hourly average each month. This means that *simultaneity* – charging your EV while cooking and doing laundry at the same time – can become more expensive than spreading out your usage.

#### Why Now?

Power tariffs are part of the Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate's regulations (EIFS 2022:1) and aim to contribute to more efficient use of the grid. The more people use the grid simultaneously, the greater the need for capacity investments – which ultimately costs everyone more.

By sending clear price signals, grid companies can encourage **demand flexibility** – meaning households and businesses shift their electricity use to times when grid load is low.

#### What Does This Mean for You?

The big change is that you as an electricity consumer have the opportunity (and responsibility) to actively influence your grid costs more than before. Examples:

- Charge your EV at night instead of right after work
- Avoid running the dishwasher, washing machine, and oven simultaneously
- Use technology that automatically load-balances your power consumption

This might sound complicated. And yes – that's *exactly why* we at Sourceful Energy are intensifying our work to develop smart services that help you understand, control, and optimize your electricity use.

#### Our Ambition

We believe technology, not you as a user, should do the work. That's why we're building solutions that connect data from the grid, electricity trading, solar production, and charging stations to control and smooth out electricity use in real-time – without you having to think about it.

Stay tuned – we'll soon be releasing tools that make all of this much easier.
