        "question": "What is V2X?",
        "answer": "V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) allows your electric vehicle to not just charge, but also discharge power back to your home (V2H) or the grid (V2G). Your EV becomes a mobile battery that can power your home, earn money from grid services, or provide backup during outages."
      },
      "requirements": {
        "question": "What do I need for V2X?",
        "answer": "You need three things: a Zap gateway (€69), a bidirectional EV charger (Ambibox is supported now, with Ferroamp, Charge Amps, Easee, and Zaptec coming soon), and a Zap Pro subscription (€60/year). Your EV must also support V2X - check our compatibility list for supported models."
      },
      "savings": {
        "question": "How much can I save with V2X?",
        "answer": "Typical V2X users save €500-1,500 per year through a combination of energy arbitrage (charging when cheap, discharging when expensive), peak shaving, and grid services participation. Actual savings depend on your electricity prices and usage patterns."
      },
      "batteryHealth": {
        "question": "Does V2X damage my EV battery?",
        "answer": "Modern EV batteries are designed for thousands of charge cycles. Our smart algorithms optimize charging patterns to minimize battery wear. Studies show V2X usage typically adds less than 1% additional degradation per year when managed properly."
      },
      "scheduling": {
        "question": "Can I still schedule my car's charging normally?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. You set your departure time and minimum charge level, and Sourceful handles the rest. Your car will always be ready when you need it - we just optimize when and how it charges (and discharges) to save you money."
      },
      "batteryDrained": {
        "question": "Will my car's battery ever be completely drained?",
        "answer": "Never. You set a minimum charge level (e.g., 20%) that we'll never go below. The system also learns your driving patterns and ensures you always have enough charge for your typical daily needs, plus a safety buffer."
      },
      "compatibleEVs": {
        "question": "Which EVs are compatible with V2X?",
        "answer": "V2X requires an EV with bidirectional charging capability. Currently supported models include most CHAdeMO vehicles (Nissan Leaf, Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV) and newer CCS vehicles with V2X support. Check our compatibility page for the full list of supported vehicles."
      },
      "technicalExpertise": {
        "question": "Do I need technical expertise to use V2X?",
        "answer": "Not at all. Once your bidirectional charger is installed by a certified electrician, you simply connect your Zap, download our app, and follow the setup wizard. The system handles all the complex optimization automatically."
